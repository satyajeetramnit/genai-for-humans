# `1.1.3: Organizing Code with Functions`

**Context & Relevance:** Now that you can make decisions and repeat tasks, your code might be getting longer and more complex. Functions are the solution to this complexity! They let you package code into reusable blocks, making your programs more organized, readable, and maintainable. This is especially crucial in AI work, where you'll be using many specialized operations repeatedly.

## 1. Introduction & Overview

Imagine if every time you wanted to calculate something, you had to rewrite all the math from scratch. That would be terribly inefficient! Functions solve this problem by letting you write a piece of code once and reuse it wherever you need it.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own functions, pass information to them, and get results back. This is a fundamental concept that will make your code cleaner and more professional.

## 2. Basic Concepts & Definitions

*   **Function:** A named block of code that performs a specific task. It can accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs.
    *   *Analogy:* Like a kitchen appliance. You put ingredients in (parameters), it does its job, and gives you a result (return value).
*   **Parameter:** A variable in the function definition that represents the input it will receive.
*   **Argument:** The actual value you pass to a function when you call it.
*   **Return Value:** The result that a function sends back to the code that called it.
*   **Scope:** The concept that variables created inside a function are separate from variables outside it.

## 3. Detailed Explanations

### Why Functions Matter

Functions help you:
1. **Avoid repetition** - Write code once, use it many times
2. **Organize code** - Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Make code readable** - Well-named functions explain what the code does
4. **Easier debugging** - Isolate problems to specific functions

### How Functions Work

```python
# Function definition
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # Code to execute
    result = parameter1 + parameter2
    return result  # Send back the result

# Function call
output = function_name(argument1, argument2)
```

## 4. Practical Examples & Code Samples

Let's create some useful functions for AI work:

```python
# A simple function to calculate square of a number
def square(number):
    result = number * number
    return result

# Using the function
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
print(square(3))  # Output: 9

# A function with multiple parameters
def calculate_bmi(weight_kg, height_m):
    """Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI)"""
    bmi = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)
    return bmi

# Using the BMI function
weight = 70
height = 1.75
my_bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
print(f"BMI: {my_bmi:.2f}")  # Output: BMI: 22.86

# A function that doesn't return anything (performs an action)
def display_welcome(name):
    """Display a welcome message"""
    print(f"Hello {name}! Welcome to the AI Assistant.")
    print("How can I help you today?")

# Using the display function
display_welcome("Alice")
```

## 5. Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

*   **Descriptive Names:** Use verbs that describe what the function does (e.g., `calculate_total`, `format_text`).
*   **Single Responsibility:** Each function should do one thing well.
*   **Use Docstrings:** Add a brief description of what the function does (triple quotes).
*   **Avoid Global Variables:** Use parameters and return values instead of modifying variables outside the function.
*   **Keep Functions Short:** If a function gets too long, consider breaking it into smaller functions.

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   Forgetting the `return` statement (function returns `None` by default)
*   Confusing parameters (variables in definition) with arguments (values passed)
*   Modifying mutable parameters in place (like lists) when you shouldn't

**üéØ Lab Exercises:**

1.  **Temperature Converter:** Create a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
2.  **Text Analyzer:** Create a function that takes a string and returns the number of words and characters
3.  **AI Response Generator:** Create a function that takes a name and mood, and returns a personalized message

Example solution for exercise 1:
```python
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f_temp):

    c_temp = (f_temp - 32) * 5/9
    return c_temp

# Test the function
print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(32))   # Output: 0.0
print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(212))  # Output: 100.0
