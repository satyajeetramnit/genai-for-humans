# `1.1.2: Controlling the Flow`

**Context & Relevance:** Now that you know how to create variables (the "nouns" of our program), it's time to make your code smarter. In this lesson, we'll learn about control flow - the "verbs" and "decision-making" parts of programming. This is how we tell the computer to make choices and repeat tasks, which is essential for handling the complex logic needed in AI.

## 1. Introduction & Overview

Right now, your code runs in a straight line from top to bottom. But what if you want your program to do different things based on different situations? Or repeat a task 100 times without writing the same line 100 times?

That's where **control flow** comes in. It allows your programs to branch out based on conditions and automate repetitive tasks. This is the foundation of creating intelligent behavior in code.

## 2. Basic Concepts & Definitions

*   **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** Code structures that allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on whether conditions are `True` or `False`.
    *   *Analogy:* Like choosing what to wear based on the weather. "IF it's raining, wear a jacket. ELSE, wear a t-shirt."
*   **Comparison Operators:** Tools to compare values (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
*   **Logical Operators:** Combine multiple conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`).
*   **Loops:** Structures that repeat code multiple times.
*   **`for` loop:** Repeats a block of code a specific number of times or for each item in a collection.
    *   *Analogy:* Like going through each student in a class to take attendance.
*   **`while` loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true.
    *   *Analogy:* Like keeping a door open WHILE someone is holding it.

## 3. Detailed Explanations

### Making Decisions with Conditionals

Life is full of choices, and so is programming. We use `if`, `elif` (else-if), and `else` statements to handle different scenarios:

```python
# Simple if statement
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a nice day!")
else:
    print("It's cold!")
```

The computer checks each condition in order and executes only the first block that matches.

### Repeating Tasks with Loops

Loops eliminate repetition and make your code more efficient:

**For Loop** - Perfect when you know how many times to repeat:
```python
# Count from 1 to 5
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)
```

**While Loop** - Great when you want to repeat until something changes:
```python
# Countdown from 5
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1  # Decrease count by 1
print("Blastoff!")
```

## 4. Practical Examples & Code Samples

Let's create a simple AI decision maker:

```python
# AI Assistant Decision Maker
weather = "rainy"
time_of_day = "morning"
has_umbrella = False

print("AI Assistant Recommendations:")
print("============================")

if weather == "rainy" and not has_umbrella:
    print("‚òî Stay indoors or buy an umbrella!")
elif weather == "sunny":
    if time_of_day == "morning":
        print("üåû Good morning! Perfect time for a walk.")
    else:
        print("üòé Great weather! Enjoy your day.")
else:
    print("ü§î Conditions are neutral. Carry on with your plans.")

# Loop through a list of tasks
print("\nYour agenda for today:")
tasks = ["Check emails", "AI project work", "Lunch break", "Meeting", "Exercise"]

for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {task}")
```

## 5. Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

*   **Indentation Matters:** Python uses indentation (spaces) to show which code belongs to which block. Typically use 4 spaces.
*   **Clear Conditions:** Write conditions that are easy to read. Use parentheses to group complex conditions.
*   **Avoid Infinite Loops:** Always ensure your while loop has a way to eventually become False.
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   Using `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (comparison) in conditions
    *   Forgetting the colon `:` at the end of conditionals and loops
    *   Not properly indenting code blocks

          If False ‚Üí Check Next Condition (elif) ‚Üí If True ‚Üí Execute Block ‚Üí Continue
