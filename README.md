# ü§ñ GenAI for Humans: No PhD Required!

> **Your friendly, step-by-step guide to going from "What's an AI?" to "I built that AI!"**

Welcome! This repository is designed to demystify Generative AI. Think of it as a friendly mentor, not a intimidating textbook. We break down complex topics into bite-sized, enjoyable pieces with lots of real-world examples, simple analogies, and hands-on projects.

> *No jargon without explanation. No concept without an analogy. No code without context.*

### **Module 2: The Generative Core** *(How the magic works)*
*   **Transformers Explained:** The "T" in GPT. We'll break down the "Attention" paper without the headache.
*   **The Model Zoo:** Meet the family: GPT, BERT, LLaMA, and others. What are they good at?
*   **Beyond Text:** How do AI models generate images, audio, and video? Intro to Stable Diffusion & more.

### **Module 3: The Application Toolkit** *(Building cool stuff)*
*   **Prompt Engineering 101:** The art of talking to AI to get what you want. It's like giving good instructions.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** How to give an AI a custom knowledge base (e.g., your company's documents) so it can answer specific questions.
*   **Fine-Tuning:** How to teach a pre-trained AI new tricks for your specific task.
*   **Building an AI App:** Putting it all together into a web application you can share.
